# Sales Dashboard using Power BI

This project contains an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard created using Global Superstore sales data. The dashboard provides key insights to help understand the data. The ETL process was performed as per the requirements, with Power Query used to clean and transform the data, and DAX used to create calculated measures and columns. Visualizations were created using cards, charts, slicers, etc., to provide meaningful insights to the end-user.
